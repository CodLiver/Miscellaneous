# Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous small scale projects that I work on (for myself or for coursework)


1. Huffman Encoder Decoder.py:

For coursework: The aim is to make a compressor and decompressor program for text files. Canonical Huffman Tree model was used. Compress rate: 50% for text files over 1Kb. The same performance is not performed in image files like .png and video files like .mp4 and .pdf, as they are already in their compressed form.

2. Software Engineering Individual Project.jar:

For coursework: The aim is to write a patient information processing program. Add/Update patients, List patients with desired attributes, Search patient info. We were given imaginery scenerio with imaginery data.

3. Computing Methodologies 3, Optimizations

For coursework: The aim is to devise an algorithm to solve Shannon Entropy, Fractional Clique Cover number problem f undirected graphs using LP solvers. The information to solve was taken from "Maximilien Gadouleau. On the possible values of the entropy of undirected graphs. Journal of Graph Theory, 82:302â€“311, 2018."
