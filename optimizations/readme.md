Computer Science Level 3 Optimizations coursework.

Aim is to solve Shannon Entropy and Fractional Clique Cover number problems with LP solvers as part of Computing Methodologies III module.


The information on how to solve these problems were taken from the following paper:

Maximilien Gadouleau. On the possible values of the entropy of undirected graphs. Journal of Graph Theory, 82:302â€“311, 2018.
