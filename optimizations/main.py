`clique NAME.bin` OR `clique N p` calculates the Fractional Clique Cover (FCC) [1] number of:

-> a graph named `NAME`.
-> a random graph with `N` amount of nodes and `p` probability of edge.

`shannon NAME.bin` OR `shannon ` calculates the Shannon Entropy (SE) [1] of

-> a graph named `NAME`.
-> a random graph with `N` amount of nodes and `p` probability of edge.

`check NAME.bin` calculates the SE and FCC of

-> a graph named `NAME`.
-> a random graph with `N` amount of nodes and `p` probability of edge.

and tells if its correct according to

shannon(G) + pi*(G)>= n  (where pi* is FCC, shannon is SE and n is node count) rule [1]
